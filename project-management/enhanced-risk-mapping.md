## Risk Interdependency Matrix

### Primary Risk Cascade Chain
**R02 (Market Validation) â†’ R03 (Financial Depletion) â†’ R04 (Personal Motivation) â†’ R05 (Execution Breakdown)**

This represents the most dangerous failure path where market assumptions prove wrong, leading to no revenue, creating financial pressure and psychological stress, ultimately causing project abandonment.

### Secondary Risk Amplification
**R01 (Technical Issues) â†” R04 (Personal Motivation) â†” R05 (Execution Breakdown)**

Technical difficulties destroy confidence, poor execution makes technical problems worse, creating a negative feedback loop.

### Risk Mitigation Priority Order
1. **R02 (Market Validation)** - Score 15 - MUST address first to prevent cascade
2. **R01 (Technical Platform)** - Score 20 - Critical but depends on market validation
3. **R04 (Personal Motivation)** - Score 12 - Enables all other mitigations
4. **R03 (Financial Depletion)** - Score 12 - Time-sensitive budget management
5. **R05 (Execution Breakdown)** - Score 12 - Process discipline requirement
