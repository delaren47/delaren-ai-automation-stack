# Project Discovery Report - Delaren AI Automation Stack

**Discovery Completion Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Project Lead:** Alfredo (Solo Digital AI Marketing & AI Consulting Agency)  
**Primary Market:** CDMX (Mexico City) Service SMBs  
**Backup Market:** Vancouver, BC Service SMBs  

---

## Executive Summary

This is a personal proof-of-concept project for Alfredo's solo consulting agency to build a bilingual (Spanish-primary, English-secondary) Voice AI + WhatsApp automation stack. The primary goal is creating a "no-brainer" solution for local SMBs while establishing a systematic lead generation process for the agency itself. Budget constraint of $1000 MXN (~$60 USD) monthly requires strategic no-code/low-code approach with future custom development via AI-assisted coding.

**Key Challenge:** Currently operating with low-ticket clients and no structured lead generation process. This project serves dual purposes: creating a marketable solution AND developing personal business systems.

- **Backup Plan:** Focus solely on Voice AI if WhatsApp platform issues persist

### Content & Localization
- **Primary Language:** Spanish (CDMX cultural fit)
- **Secondary Language:** English (Vancouver market backup)
